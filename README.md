# Connect-4
University project edited by python programming language


This is one of my university stage 1 assignment, it used OOP in python programming language to generate the game called "connect-4".
To judge how player get score, when there are 4 in a row or column or diagonal position, then it counts 1 score.

The game will play with a robot as the game starts, then it record the score down the chess board.

Most of the code content was edited based on software testing assistance i.e coderunner. 

One of the function called "summary", it shows the coordinates of how players win and the final winner.
